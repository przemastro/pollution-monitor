## PollutionMonitor

#### Python + Plotly + SQL Server 

They say Poland is the most polluted country in Europe. For the next year I will be gathering data from https://aqicn.org. 
Mostly Air Quality Index value for 7 cities: Poznan(Poland), Cordoba(Spain), Liverpool(UK), Nijmegen(Netherlands), Hanover(Germany), 
Toulouse(France) and Gent(Belgium). The criteria was simple: Similar size, similar number of citizens, similar distance from the coast.

Let's find out who really has the worst air and confront this with the media myths.

For the purpose of this investigation I will be using: SQL Server as data storage, python requests to get data from https://aqicn.org 
and plotly library to plot reults.
